      <p> I am a Junior Computer Science Major, with an aspiration to go into Cybersecurity. My hobbies included baking,
        cosplaying, sewing, and crocheting. I'm really into fashion specifically Lolita and J-fashion, and often upcycle
        or construct my clothing. My family and I are very close, both my brother and sister are older than me. </p>
